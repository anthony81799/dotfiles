# Roadmap

- Snapper snapshots do not work yet
- install, npm and node before doing Rust install to allow for Helix install
- investigate yazelix as terminal based development environment
- Nix does not currently work with Selinux enabled (should be removed for now)
- docker is installed but services fail to start
- find a better to to exit scripts on failure ````exit 1``` causes the entire install process to stop
